# K Nearest Neighbors Regressor
This model uses previous data to find the target of new data. It finds the 5 nearest dots to the new data (as shown in the image). Unlike in K Nearest Neighbors Classifier, which takes a vote to see which cluster the new data will be put into, K Nearest Neighbors Regressor takes the average target of the nearby dots as it's answer.
